# IPDLN hackathon

Code from a hackathon held on 11th Septemeber 2018 at the IPDLN conference in Banff, Canada. 

Work here was done with Sumeet Kalia from the University of Toronto. 

The project structure in this repo is based on [the workflow described by Joris Muller here](http://blog.jom.link/implementation_basic_reproductible_workflow.html).
