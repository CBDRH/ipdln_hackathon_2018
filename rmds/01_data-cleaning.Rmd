## Introduction

This is the code used to import and clean the provided data files for the Hackathon. Factors are relevelled so that the logistic regression outout agrees with SAS.


###Packages

Load packages required...

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr) #Pipe operators
library(feather)
library(sf)    #maps and shapefile reading
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 16))
```

###Data

Load data - 

Note that the synthetic data is for the use of the workshop only and is therefore included in the `.gitignore` file. This means data is on the local computer only and is not pushed to the GitHub repository.

I've downloaded some population estimates for each of the provinces which will help with some of the analysis from the Statistics Canada website [here](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901).

I've also downloaded a shapefile of Canadian provinces from [this link](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2011-eng.cfm) as I think it will be nice to map some of the variables.

```{r load_data}
raw_data <- read_csv(here::here("raw_data/ipdln_synth_final.csv"))
shapefile <- read_sf(here::here("raw_data/wether_gov_shapefile/province.shp"))
```


##Clean data

###Glimpse

The first thing I'll do is get a quick skim of the `raw-data` file to get an idea of its structure

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(raw_data)
```

Ok. All these variables are categorical and we need to label the values as per the metadata held in the `metadata` file folder (see [the github repo](https://github.com/davidhen/ipdln_hackathon) for files),
but change some of the levels so that we get the correct reference classes in `glm()`.

###Missing data

Before we factorise everything - we'd like to check if there is any missing data in the data frame

```{r visdat}
map_df(raw_data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

Great, there are no missing values.

###Clean names and factorise

```{r tidy_names}
raw_data %<>% 
  rename(ab_id_dichot = ABDERR_synth) %>% 
  mutate(ab_id_dichot = factor(ab_id_dichot,
                               levels = c(1, 2),

###Save

We'll save the cleaned dataset with a new name `clean_data` which can be loaded directly in other analysis files, using the feather package which is much faster than the base R `save()` and `load()`.

```{r save, eval=FALSE}
clean_data <- raw_data
write_feather(clean_data, path=here("assets/clean_data.feather"))
rm(raw_data)
```


##Shapefile

**also try https://www.weather.gov/gis/CanadianProvinces**

Quick look at the shapefile to make sure everything is in order

```{r shape}
glimpse(shapefile)
```

Need to change one variable name and drop some unneeded variables

```{r shape_clean}
shapefile %<>% 
  rename(province = NAME) %>% 
  select(province, geometry)
```


And a quick plot of the blank file to check it looks ok

```{r plot_shape, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, eval=TRUE}
shapefile %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme(line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_line(colour = "transparent"))
```

###Save it

```{r save_shp, eval=TRUE}
save(shapefile, file = here::here("assets/clean_data/shapefile.rds"))
```


#Session info

```{r session_info, cache=FALSE}
devtools::session_info()
```
